<!-- Psudo code:
                1. Create an HTML file
                2. Create a <Script> inside the body of the HTML
                3. Create a String called displayMessage and assign the following string: "You have received this message because you have
                    been chosen to open an important vault. Here is the secret combination:" 
                4. Create three variables and assign them values using different arithmetic operations
                5. Concatenate the displayMessage and the three integers and display it using the alert() function. Also use String literals to
                   display the message over multiple lines
